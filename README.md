### KITTYPULSE
Your personal, mischievous cat that loves to sleep on top of your minimized active windows.

### REQUIREMENTS
- UCRT64 toolchain
- SDL3 (Do not use SDL2, as most APIs have been migrated or deprecated)
- CMake >= 3.25

### NOTE
- This project is primarily for Win32 builds only.
- Time is limited, so it consists of a single main file with no external modules.
- The cat's texture will change in contrast to the dominant colors of your desktop background image.
